You are given three integer lists of same length deadlines, credits, and durations representing course assignments.
For the ith assignment deadlines[i] represents its deadline, credits[i] represents its credit, and durations[i] represents the number of days
it takes to finish the assignment. If you start an assignment, 
it must be finished before another assignment can be started.

You are given three integer lists of same length deadlines, credits, and durations representing course assignments. For the ith assignment deadlines[i] 
represents its deadline, credits[i] represents its credit, and durations[i] represents the number of days it takes to finish the assignment. If you start an assignment, it must be finished before another assignment can be started.

Note that you can work on an assignment on the day it's due and you're currently on the start of day 0.

Return the maximum credit you can obtain by finishing some subset of the assignments.
