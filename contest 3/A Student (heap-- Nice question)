You are given two integer lists of the same length, deadlines and credits representing course assignments.
deadlines[i] represents the deadline day for assignment i and credits[i] represents the amount of credits you get for assignment i. 
Each assignment takes one day to complete, and can be done before or on the deadline day.
You can't work on two assignments on the same day.


You are given two integer lists of the same length, deadlines and credits representing course assignments. 
deadlines[i] represents the deadline day for assignment i and credits[i] represents the amount of credits you get for assignment i.
Each assignment takes one day to complete, and can be done before or on the deadline day. You can't work on two assignments on the same day.

Note that you can work on an assignment on the day it's due and you're currently on the start of day 0.

Return the maximum credit you can obtain by finishing some subset of the assignments.

Constraints

Length of deadlines ≤ 5000
deadlines[i] ≤ 10000
Example 1
Input
deadlines = [0, 1]
credits = [3, 2]
Output
5
Explanation
We can take both assignments.


int solve(vector<int>& deadlines, vector<int>& credits) {
    vector<pair<int,int>> arr;

    for(int i=0;i<credits.size();i++){
        arr.push_back({deadlines[i],credits[i]});
    }
    sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());

    int res=0;
    priority_queue<int> pq;
    for(int i=10000;i>=0;i--){

        while(arr.size() && arr.back().first==i){
            pq.push(arr.back().second);
            arr.pop_back();
        }

        if(pq.size()){
            res+=pq.top();
            pq.pop();
        }
    }
    return res;
}
