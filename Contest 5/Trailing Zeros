Given a positive integer k, consider the smallest positive integer x which all integers from 1..k inclusive divide evenly. 
That is, consider the smallest x where x % 1 == 0, x % 2 == 0, ..., x % k == 0.

Return the number of trailing zeroes in x.

int solve(int k) {
      int fs = 0;
    while (k /= 5) {
        fs++;
    }
    return fs;
}
