Given a string s of lowercase alphabet characters, and an integer k, return the minimum number of changes needed in the string
(one change involves changing a single character to any other character) 
so that the resulting string has at most k distinct characters.


int solve(string s, int k) {
     int freq[26] = {0};
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
        freq[s[i] - 'a']++;
    }
    sort(freq, freq + 26, greater<int>());
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = k; i < 26; i++) count += freq[i];
    return count;
}
