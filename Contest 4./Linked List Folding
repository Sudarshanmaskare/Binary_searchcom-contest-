You are given a singly linked list node containing integer values. Take the first half of the linked list and fold over 
the second half and merge the intersecting nodes by taking their sum.


LLNode* solve(LLNode* node) {
    LLNode *slow = node, *fast = node;
    stack<int> s;

    while (fast && fast->next) {
        s.push(slow->val);
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = (fast->next)->next;
    }

    node = slow;
    if (fast) slow = slow->next;

    while (slow && !s.empty()) {
        int x = s.top();
        s.pop();
        slow->val += x;
        slow = slow->next;
    }
    return node;
}
